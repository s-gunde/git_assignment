# Git Assignment - \<s-gunde\>

====================================================

a. What is an issue?
An issue is basically a way to keep track of things that need to be done in a project. It could be a bug that needs fixing, a feature someone wants to add, or any task that needs attention. On platforms like GitHub, issues help teams stay organized by letting them discuss and prioritize work in one place.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request, often called a PR, is like saying, "Hey, I've made some changes in my part of the code. Can you check it out and, if everything looks good, merge it into the main codebase?" It’s a way to share your work with others, get feedback, and make sure the changes fit well with the rest of the project before they’re officially added.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Start with a New Branch: First, create a new branch for your work. It’s like having your own space to make changes without affecting the main code.
Make Your Changes: Do the work you need to do—write your code, fix bugs, whatever it is.
Save Your Changes: Once you’re done, commit your changes so they’re saved in your branch.
Push to GitHub: Push your branch to GitHub so others can see your work.
Create a Pull Request: On GitHub, go to the pull requests section, start a new one, and choose the branches you want to merge. Usually, this means merging your new branch into the main one.
Describe Your Work: Give some details about what you did so others understand the changes.
Request Reviews: If needed, ask teammates to review your work.
Submit the Pull Request: Finally, submit it and wait for feedback.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
Go to Your Repo: Open your repository on GitHub.
Head to Settings: Find the settings tab and click it.
Manage Access: Look for the section where you can manage access or collaborators.
Invite a Collaborator: Type in the person’s GitHub username or email and send them an invite.
Set Permissions: Decide what level of access they should have (like read or write permissions).
Send the Invite: Once they accept, they’ll have the permissions you granted.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is the tool that helps you track changes in your code. It’s like a supercharged save system that also keeps track of who made what changes and lets you work on different versions of your project at the same time.

GitHub is a place where you can store your Git projects online, making it easier to share with others, collaborate, and manage everything from issues to pull requests. It’s like a social network for your code.

f. What does git diff do?
git diff is a command that shows you what’s different between your current code and what’s saved in the last commit or between different versions. It’s super handy for reviewing changes before you finalize them.

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the primary line of development in your project. It’s where the final, polished code lives, and it’s usually the branch that gets deployed to production. Think of it as the “official” version of your code.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
Nope, As a good practise, it’s better not to push changes directly to the main branch. Instead, create a new branch for your work, then use a pull request to merge it into the main branch once everything’s been reviewed and tested. This way, you keep the main branch stable and free from unexpected bugs.
