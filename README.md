# Git Assignment - \<s-gunde\>

====================================================
a. What is an issue?
An issue is basically a way to keep track of things that need to be done in a project. It could be a bug that needs fixing, a feature someone wants to add, or any task that needs attention. On platforms like GitHub, issues help teams stay organized by letting them discuss and prioritize work in one place.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request, often called a PR, is like saying, "Hey, I've made some changes in my part of the code. Can you check it out and, if everything looks good, merge it into the main codebase?" It’s a way to share your work with others, get feedback, and make sure the changes fit well with the rest of the project before they’re officially added.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

f. What does git diff do?

g. What is the main branch?

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
